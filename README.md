# NumPy-Mini-Projects

## I Done some Projects that uses only NumPy and Python

## Project List

### 1. Matrix Operations Visualizer
       This project will help you understand how matrices are represented and manipulated computationally.

### 2. Statistical Data Generator
       This project will help you practice generating synthetic datasets, understanding distributions, and calculating statistical metrics such as mean, median, variance, and correlation.

### 3. Data Normalization and Scaling Tool
       This is an important project because real-world data often comes in varying scales, and machine learning models perform better when the data is normalized or scaled properly.
