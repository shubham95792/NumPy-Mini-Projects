# NumPy-Mini-Projects

## I Done some Projects that uses only NumPy and Python

## Project List

### 1. Matrix Operations Visualizer
     This project will help you understand how matrices are represented and manipulated computationally.


### 2. Statistical Data Generator
     This project will help you practice generating synthetic datasets, understanding distributions, and calculating statistical metrics such as mean, median, variance, and correlation.


### 3. Data Normalization and Scaling Tool
     This is an important project because real-world data often comes in varying scales, and machine learning models perform better when the data is normalized or scaled properly.


### 4. K-Means Clustering
     This is a powerful algorithm in machine learning for grouping similar data points. Implementing it from scratch will strengthen your understanding of distance metrics, iteration, convergence, and data grouping all using arrays.


### 5. Financial Portfolio Analysis (Basic Version)
     This project will help you understand how to compute basic financial metrics like returns, variance, and correlation are essential tools for managing and analyzing investments.
